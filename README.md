**Contributor Notes:**

•	Mapped elements represent where the DPDPA requires a control that would fall under the NIST Core subcategory or a control under the NIST Core subcategory would support activities under the DPDPA. 
•	To make it easier for readers, the DPDPA legislation has been broken down chapter wise. Sections and Subsections have been mapped against relevant sections of the NIST Privacy Framework V1.0 in the NIST Privacy V1.0 Core to DPDPA worksheet.
•	Quick Reference worksheet has the DPDPA sections mapped to actual citation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 as well as mapping to the relevant sections of the EU GDPR to provide better context.
•	Readers will also notice that many of the Privacy Framework’s subcategories do not map neatly to the DPDPA. The DPDPA is an “umbrella” legislation, as it sets out only a high-level framework for India’s new data protection regime, with supplementary rules expected in due course. 

**Methodology **
•	The NIST Privacy Framework was retrieved from the https://www.nist.gov/document/nist-privacy-framework-v10-core and the DPDPA ACT was retrieved from MEITY https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023.pdf 
•	I utilized the Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool CPRT and manually mapped to the DPDPA Act 2023.

**Historical Context**
•	Prior to the DPDPA, India’s data protection rules are made up of Section 43A and 87(2)(ob) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011.
•	In a historic decision delivered on 24th August 2017, the Indian Supreme Court bench unanimously recognised the fundamental right to privacy of every individual as guaranteed by the Constitution, within Article 21 in particular and Part III on the whole. 
•	The ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) constituted A 10-member panel headed by retired Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna in August 2017 to arrive at a data protection bill. https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf
•	The first draft of the Data Protection Bill came out in 2018. After various rounds of amendment in 2019 and 2021, the bill was scrapped and replaced with the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022. 
•	On 18 November 2022, MEITY released the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022 for public consultation.
•	The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was passed by Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian Parliament) on August 7, 2023, and by the Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian Parliament) on August 9, 2023. The DPDPA received the President’s assent and was enacted into law on August 11, 2023. Factors such as accountability, transparency, data minimisation, fairness, accuracy, and lawful processing of personal data have been reflected in the DPDPA. It addresses Data Principals as ‘she/her,’ which is unseen in any Indian law till date and sets the tone in a new light.
•	The DPDPA is “umbrella” legislation, as it sets out only a high-level framework for India’s new data protection regime, with supplementary rules expected in due course.
